# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status
This is a new IntelliCRM project directory that is currently empty. The project structure and development commands will need to be established as the codebase is initialized.

## Notes for Development
- This appears to be intended as an intelligent CRM system based on the directory name
- No existing codebase structure, configuration files, or development commands have been identified yet
- Future updates to this file should include:
  - Package manager and build system commands once established
  - Project architecture and key directories
  - Testing and linting commands
  - Database setup and migration commands if applicable
  - Deployment procedures
